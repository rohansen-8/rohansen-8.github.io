### Certifications

 - [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/eb8773c0-fab6-4ca3-8795-75823ddb7a6a/public_url)

## Interests

- **Travelling**, seeing the world and how different cultures have various answers to  the same challenges everyone faces (what should a house look like, how to treat each-other, etc.).

- **Eating spicy food**, which is something I mainly learned during my semester abroad in South Korea; "spicy" is different in every place!

- **History**, to clarify why things are as they are.

- **Urban design**, which (invisibly) guides many of our day-to-day activities.


## Extra activities

- **Summerschool "Big Data Analytics"**, KTH Executive School; 2020, August  
  Intensive two weeks, wherein I developed a business plan with coaching of professionals. My idea was to measure sewer lines more extensively to prevent blockages and sewer floods; this could be measured by putting sensors underneath manhole covers.
  
- **Vice President, Dies Committee**, DSCC/DJCR 'Audentis et Virtutis'; 2016, December - 2017, March  
  Organized two weeks full of activities for ± 300 students, including a gala in a manor house. I took care of the communication (internal and external), general structure and management, and the website. 

### Hackathons

- **(Re)Visit Europe: finding sustainable destinations**, CASSINI; 2022, May  
  The challenge of CASSINI was to use EU space data and apply it to the tourism sector. Project DAt uses air quality measurements to recommend routes and destinations for short-distance travels that meets an individual's need from a health perspective. The targeted users are people who are sensitive to air pollution or pollen. The short-term future would be forecast using a regression model.
  
- **Design of an AI solution to detect fake news**, EFSA; 2021, February  
  <i class="fas fa-award"></i><strong> Winning team</strong>; public procurement hackathon for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). We created a Software as a Service (SaaS) using the <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4">Universal Sentence Encoder</a> with EFSA published documents as "ground truth". A statement regarding food can be put into the online user-friendly application, after which an EFSA API call is made to gather the documents and the semantic similarity is calculated with the encoder. This lead to an explainable model that could identify misinformation very fast for various statements.
  
- **Finnish Education**, Junction 2020 Connected; 2020, November  
  Project DAT was to showcase how the current unused data of Opetushallitus (Finnish governmental body responsible for Education) could be visualized to give a transparent outcome of the funded educational projects. The messy data has been traversed and translated manually (as all was in Finnnish), which resulted in a clear overview showing the data structure of the parts identified as most relevant from the dataset. Lastly, an intuitive dashboard was created for the end-user. The result was rated a 9 by the case-owner, just falling short of the first prize. 

- **Satellite Image Analytics**, JunctionX Seoul; 2020, October  
  <i class="fas fa-award"></i><strong> 1st prize</strong>; project <a href="https://github.com/bonomoon/SUMO">SUMO</a>(SUstainability MOnitoring) makes it able to search for factories and check where their waste is actually going by using satellite images. It analyses the landfill locations and checks if they are actually increasing more than they should. This tool is free to use for transparency and more in-depth analysis is a paid feature for companies to further investigate their manufacturers and suppliers. I was the project manager of the team and, therefore, coordinated tasks. Besides that, I defined the problem, solution and business; which I <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EsYEhJjpHUl9OcyRlOcsemfFxan95qos/view">pitched</a>.
  
- **From Farm to Fork**, EIT Deephack; 2020, June   
  Project Farmony aimed to bridge the gap between urban and rural life with the help of a digital fun-farming experience. The idea was to crowdfund farmland in the user's area. The user could track the progress in a similiar fashion as for example Farmville. After the harvest, the user gets some of this produce. The farmer would receive a steady predictable income and the global supply chain would be shortened.
  
- **Data against COVID-19**, EIT Deephack; 2020, May   
  Project Modum aimed to tie the economic effects to the measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we developed three complementary aspects: 1) GDP differences (after measures were taken) to train a prediction model 2) web scraping of news on which the sentiment of economic articles was found and 3) a dashboard in React to showcase this information.
